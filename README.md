# 💡 ContentMessageHelper
<i>ContentMessageHelper is a Minecraft plugin to help create clear messages for Content staff</i> <br>
I hope you'll be able to find a good use for my plugin. It's nothing special, yet it's pretty useful!

## 📚 Available Commands
<b>/chatclear</b> - Clear a few lines from your chat <br>
<b>/empty <Message></b> - Create an empty message with your own input (with ColorCode Support). This is no broadcast function!
